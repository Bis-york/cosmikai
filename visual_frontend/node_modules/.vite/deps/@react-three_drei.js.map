These can\r\n *        be accessed and manipulated via the resulting material's `uniforms` property, just like\r\n *        in a ShaderMaterial. You do not need to repeat the base material's own uniforms here.\r\n * @param {String=} options.timeUniform - If specified, a uniform of this name will be injected into\r\n *        both shaders, and it will automatically be updated on each render frame with a number of\r\n *        elapsed milliseconds. The \"zero\" epoch time is not significant so don't rely on this as a\r\n *        true calendar time.\r\n * @param {String=} options.vertexDefs - Custom GLSL code to inject into the vertex shader's top-level\r\n *        definitions, above the `void main()` function.\r\n * @param {String=} options.vertexMainIntro - Custom GLSL code to inject at the top of the vertex\r\n *        shader's `void main` function.\r\n * @param {String=} options.vertexMainOutro - Custom GLSL code to inject at the end of the vertex\r\n *        shader's `void main` function.\r\n * @param {String=} options.vertexTransform - Custom GLSL code to manipulate the `position`, `normal`,\r\n *        and/or `uv` vertex attributes. This code will be wrapped within a standalone function with\r\n *        those attributes exposed by their normal names as read/write values.\r\n * @param {String=} options.fragmentDefs - Custom GLSL code to inject into the fragment shader's top-level\r\n *        definitions, above the `void main()` function.\r\n * @param {String=} options.fragmentMainIntro - Custom GLSL code to inject at the top of the fragment\r\n *        shader's `void main` function.\r\n * @param {String=} options.fragmentMainOutro - Custom GLSL code to inject at the end of the fragment\r\n *        shader's `void main` function. You can manipulate `gl_FragColor` here but keep in mind it goes\r\n *        after any of ThreeJS's color postprocessing shader chunks (tonemapping, fog, etc.), so if you\r\n *        want those to apply to your changes use `fragmentColorTransform` instead.\r\n * @param {String=} options.fragmentColorTransform - Custom GLSL code to manipulate the `gl_FragColor`\r\n *        output value. Will be injected near the end of the `void main` function, but before any\r\n *        of ThreeJS's color postprocessing shader chunks (tonemapping, fog, etc.), and before the\r\n *        `fragmentMainOutro`.\r\n * @param {function({fragmentShader: string, vertexShader:string}):\r\n *        {fragmentShader: string, vertexShader:string}} options.customRewriter - A function\r\n *        for performing custom rewrites of the full shader code.

These\r\n * will also set a custom `#define IS_DEPTH_MATERIAL` or `#define IS_DISTANCE_MATERIAL` that you can look\r\n * for in your derived shaders with `#ifdef` to customize their behavior for the depth or distance\r\n * scenarios, e.g. skipping antialiasing or expensive shader logic.\r\n */\r\nfunction createDerivedMaterial(baseMaterial, options) {\r\n  // Generate a key that is unique to the content of these `options`.
